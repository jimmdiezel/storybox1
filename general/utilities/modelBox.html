<h2>Sample Xone</h2>

</div>

<p class="textA">Sample Xone was taken from a secret location in Southwark. The dataset is compiled of 11 assessments from the 4th Quarter of 2016. It was completed while the HTA was under construction and so the question differ slightly from HTAv1.11. The report was completed by an amateur statistician as a brief demonstration of the potential of any statistical analysis into the data collected by the HTA.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

</div>

<p class="textA">The basic and grand average results matched most in <strong>safety</strong> and <strong>solidarity</strong> with neither having excessive or consolidation or distribution.</p>

<p class="textA"><strong>Meritocracy</strong> produced the worst basic average result with strong agreement depicted in the minimal distribution between results. When the median and mode were taken into account it made little difference although the results of other elements were significantly reduced when these factors were accounted.</p>

<p class="textA">The worst complex average was in <strong>security</strong>. This element produced the 3rd highest distribution of figures with the most popular answer being 2 out of 7. The average in this case was misleading and further analysis reflects the underlying lack of job security faced by participants in sample 2.</p>

<p class="textA"><strong>Community (family)</strong> and <strong>personal input (recognition)</strong> also saw a significant fall in rank when the complex average was compared with the basic average. <strong>Community (family)</strong> value took the most dramatic numerical fall when compared with <strong>security</strong> and <strong>input</strong>.</p>

<p class="textA">The only figures to rise after the complex average measurement were: <strong>professional development, ecology, equality and personal growth. Environment</strong> and <strong>equality</strong> were relatively good in both average measures. When complex average was measured <strong>personal growth</strong> reflected the most significant rise in general and in rank. Negative results for <strong>personal growth</strong> were generally distributed at ‘slightly inadequate’ with a few marked as ‘completely inadequate’ bringing the basic average below the complex average.</p>

<p class="textA">The most concerning results were for <strong>dignity</strong>. The basic average was the 3rd highest ranked but this fell 6 points to 9th under complex average. <strong>Dignity</strong> had the highest degree of distribution of all results with those that were satisfied giving this element the highest results. Concerns relate to the numerous results showing complete dissatisfaction with <strong>dignity</strong> at London City with it’s most popular answer being the lowest 1 out of 7. These results warrant further investigation to determine the source of dissatisfaction and why <strong>dignity</strong> at London City is so unevenly distributed.</p>
